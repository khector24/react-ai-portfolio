      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Hi, I'm <strong>Kenny Hector</strong>, a multilingual full-stack
        developer from Haiti with a passion for building clean, scalable, and
        user-centered web applications. I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science
        from Saint Thomas Aquinas College and speak three languages. My work
        blends creativity, performance, and problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
        I‚Äôm AWS Certified and have built real-world systems for both businesses
        and clients. While working at Rainbow Ace Hardware, I led a team of 25+
        and developed internal applications using JavaFX and MySQL, improving
        inventory accuracy and streamlining in-store logistics. My technical
        solutions helped cut checkout times by 47% and eliminated repeated
        manual processes.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
        On the client side, I designed and deployed responsive websites like the{" "}
        <strong>Splash Zone Aquatics</strong> platform using React, Material UI,
        AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB‚Äîresulting in 13 early client signups. I've also
        built cloud-first applications for theft reporting and delivery tracking
        using secure AWS services, JWT authentication, and real-time updates.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
        I‚Äôm experienced with RESTful APIs, automation tools, and secure system
        design, and I always prioritize maintainability and performance. My
        projects often involve tight integration between frontend UI and backend
        logic to create seamless, reliable systems.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
        When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy hiking, reading, and diving into new tech
        trends. I value continuous learning and am always seeking to grow,
        collaborate, and build meaningful solutions.
      </p>
